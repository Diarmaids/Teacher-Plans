# Teachers' Plans (Static Prototype)

This is a zero-build static prototype of your storefront. It uses:
- **React 18** via CDN
- **Tailwind (Play CDN)** for styling

### Deploy (beginner friendly)

1. Create a GitHub repo called `teachers-plans`.
2. Upload these files (or push with Git).
3. On **Vercel**, click *New Project* → import `teachers-plans`.
4. Vercel detects a **static site** (no build). Deploy and you're live at `https://<project>.vercel.app`.

### Custom domain
- Buy `teachersplans.ie` (or similar) and add it in Vercel → *Settings → Domains*.
- Copy DNS records from Vercel to your domain registrar.

### Next steps (optional, when ready)
- Replace the CDN prototype with a **Next.js + Stripe + CMS** setup for e-commerce and file delivery.
- Until then, this is perfect to share the look & feel and content structure publicly.

### Prices
- Individual plans: **€10**
- Bundles: **€50**
